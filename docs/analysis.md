# Software development Phases in every software development
 * Requirement gathering and analysis.
 * Design.
 * implementation and coading.
 * Testing.
 * Deployment.
 * Maintenance.

# Different type of software development model
## Waterfall model
* Sequential flow
* Development process begins only if the previous phase is complete.
* Doesnt define the process to go back to the previous phase to handle changes in requirement.
## V shape model
## Prototyping model
## Spiral model
## Iterative and incremental model
## Agile for ML project.(Main point is client and developer work together in project)
* continuous improvement
* Agile methodologies are open to changing requirements over time and encourages constant feedback from the end users.

#### The Agile Manifesto lists 12 principles to guide teams on how to execute with agility. These are the principles:
* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customerâ€™s competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
